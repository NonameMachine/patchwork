    This release is one of the smaller releases. The primary new feature is
    the ability to mark comments as addressed/unaddressed, allowing maintainers
    to track work items. In addition, two new events have been added to the
    ``/events`` API: ``cover-comment-created`` and ``patch-comment-created``.
    Recent versions of Python (3.10) and Django (3.2, 4.0) are now supported,
    while support for older Python (3.6) and Django (2.2, 3.0, 3.1) versions
    has been removed. More information on all the above is included below.
